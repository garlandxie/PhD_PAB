# Materials and Methods

### Study system

The Meadoway is a 16 km stretch of urban green space (UGS) and meadow
lands, situated within a large metropolitan city (Toronto, Canada). Due
to its relative large distribution, this UGS is going to be one of
Canada's largest linear urban parks that will provide valuable habitats
for butterflies, birds, and wildflowers between downtown Toronto and the
Rouge National Urban Park.

Restoration began in 2012 at certain parts of the Meadoway, which
include seeding portions with native species, mowing, and invasive
species management. Monitoring activities, for a small number of plots,
have began in 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 to document changes in flora
species composition. Recent monitoring reports have included information
on the identity and abundance of three invasive species: *Vincetoxicum
rossicum* (Kleopow) Bordhidi, *Alliaria petiolata* (M. Bieb.) Cavara &
Grande, and *Polygonum cuspidatum* (Siebold & Zucc.).

### Study species

Dog-strangling vine, otherwise known as *Vincetoxicum rossicum*
(Kleopow) Bordhidi (Apocynaceae), is a pervasive invasive plant in
Toronto, Canada. It is originally from Ukraine, Russia but it was
introduced to eastern North America in the 1800's. It is a perennial
vine, where its stems range from 40 to 200 cm in length, emerge
vertically in late April-early May, and then begin to twine together in
mid-summer if they do not find a climbing structure [@ditommaso2005].

In the past few decades, there has been great interest in studying this
plant because it has spread so widely in its invaded range and it is
known to degrade native biodiversity and ecosystem services
[@livingstone2020].

## Statistical analysis: Structural equation modeling

**Step 1: Defining the goals of the analysis**

The analysis presented here has two goals. The first goal is to examine
the relative importance of three different invasion drivers (i.e.,
propagule pressure, disturbance, and resident plant diversity) on the
plant invasibility of *Vincetoxicum rossicum* within a 16 km stretch of
restored urban meadowlands (Toronto, Canada). We are motivated to
understand the mediating factors and processes connecting the impact of
[anthropogenic activities?] to [biological changes?]. The second goal is
to specify our structural equation models in such a form that
practitioners can prioritize management strategies that will potentially
guide the protection or restoration of native plant communities by
reducing the population size and distribution of *Vincetoxicum
rossicum*. Both goals imply that our system of primary interest is the
urban meadowlands in and around the Meadoway and we wish to generalize
to that set. Inferences to other meadow ecosystems is a side benefit.

```

\newpage

**Step 5: Evaluation of specification options for the SE models: (a)
Focus of the analysis**

The primary goal for SEM application in this particular model system is
"response focused". Here, I place priority for understanding and
explaining variation in a particular property of a system. In this case,
I am developing a model to understand what drives the plant invasibility
of *Vincetoxicum rossicum* in a large urban green space. Is it propagule
pressure? Disturbance?] Or just invasion resistance by the resident
plant community? Or two or more drivers explaining variation in
invasibility? In such cases, the response of interest (including its
spatial and temporal properties) is first selected and then theory and
data are used to build an understanding of the main drivers influencing
variations in invasibility.

## Experimental protocols

### Invasibility

Invasibility can be defined as "the [intrinsic] susceptibility of
biological communities to colonization and dominance of introduced
organisms" [@lonsdale1999; @alpert2000]. This term reflects the number
of open niches within the community, and often is thought to be mainly
controlled by resource availability (e.g., [@davis2000]).

Historically, the terms invasibility and degree of invasion have been
used interchangeably, which makes it difficult to generalize patterns
and processes in invasion biology. Although, there is a positive
relationship between degree of invasion (DI) and invasibility. A
community with low invasibility cannot have high DI, but one with high
invasibility could either show low or high DI depending on extrinsic
factors [@guo2015a].

In this study, I am going to use a generic metric for quantifying
estimated invasibility ($I_{e}$) of a community in the Meadoway
(Toronto, ON), based on relative resident species richness and
abundance:

$I_{e} = 1 - (h*\frac{S_{obs}}{S_{max}} + (1-h)*(\frac{B_{obs}}{B_{max}}) )$
(equation 1)

where $S_{obs}$ and $B_{obs}$ are the observed plot-level richness and
biomass, whereas $S_{max}$ and $B_{max}$ are maximum plot-level richness
and biomass, respectively, within the habitat type (i.e., resource-based
carrying capacity).

Incorporating both species richness and biomass resolves many issues
than if one were to measure each alone [@levine1999]. Some issues with
using species richness alone are : (1) invasions can still take place if
even "saturated" communities (high species richness) because of temporal
population fluctuations of dominant species, (2) high species richness
indicates more occupied niches, but species still need time to fill that
niche, (3) high species does not necessarily equal to high community
biomass, (4) native and exotic species richness can have a positive
correlation as both increase with increasing area and heterogeneity
[@moore2001]. Further a limitation of biomass is that it alone misses
the importance of invader identity and sampling effect [@huston1997].

Invasibility should be referred to the maximum possible richness and
biomass in the habitat as indicators of the overall habitat capacity
[@davis2000]. Here, the generic metric of invasibility incorporates
habitat capacity through the $h$ which is is a habitat-specific
weighting parameter that has a value between 0 to 1. This parameter thus
accounts for the variability among communities in how much biomass and
species richness contribute to niche utilization [@guo2015a].

The variables, $S_{obs}$, $S_{max}$, $B_{obs}$, and $B_{max}$ are
estimated from field measurements where I will collect (and sort)
species-specific biomass (in grams) after cutting the ramets of each
plant individual. The parameter $h$ can be derived from the slope from
the relationship between $\frac{S_{obs}}{S_{max}}$ and
$\frac{B_{obs}}{B_{max}}$ (see Figure 4; below). The range of $I_{e}$ is
from 0 to 1, which allows researchers to compare invasibility across
different communities and even successional stages [@guo2015a].

Finally, it is important to note that $I_{e}$ is sensitive to outliers
(see [@guo2015a] for a thoughtful discussion). If there is a legitimate
outlier (e.g., abnormally high species richness or biomass), then you
have three options: (1) remove the outlier from the analysis, (2) define
the maximum value using the 95th percentile, or (3) increase the sample
size.

### Propagule pressure

Measuring propagule pressure is difficult. For one, it is a composite
measure of both propagule size and frequency [@simberloff2009]. Adding
to that, it is rare to find a metric that encompasses both aspects.

Propagule size is easier to quantify than propagule frequency, and a
good example would be the number of germinants from a seed bank analysis
[@eschtruth2011]. This metric circumvents many issues such as (1) it
reflects natural variation in seed availability among sites
[@clark2007], (2) it accommodates different dispersal vectors and
long-term distance dispersal events, (3) it quantifies naturally
occurring level of propagules as opposed to proxies such as number of
human visitors [@wonham2013a], and (4) it is favored over seedlings
(which does not account for factors affect seed survival and
germination). The choice of a reasonable index of propagule pressure is
important here because it allows researchers to correctly examine the
relationship between invasibility and its determinants. If the number of
germinants is not responsible for driving invasibility, then it could be
other drivers such as soil fertility, disturbance, or even biotic
interactions [@houseman2014].

#### Seed germination index

To measure the number of germinants, I will take five soil samples at
each plot (*i.e.,* 1 m2), which I will later combine into a single
composite seed bank sample per plot. Seed banks tend to form small-scale
spatial structure where mother plants disperse many seeds in their
nearby vicinity (even if they use long-dispersal distances), leading to
randomly distributed patterns [@plue2012a]. To account for such spatial
patterns, each sample will be collected at a distance of 15 -30 cm
<!--#  double-check with Scott --> outside of plot boundaries to ensure
spatial independence **(cite Legendre 1993)**, so that there is an
unbiased estimate of plot-level seed bank characteristics after all of
the samples are aggregated as a composite sample [@plue2012a]. According
to one study [@plue2012a] that examined three different habitats
(*i.e.,* forests, heathlands, and grasslands), the number of seeds found
in the seed bank does not differ between sampling strategy (*i.e.*,
random, systematic, and stratified).

Before sampling, I will remove any surface litter layer (or gravel) but
include the fine component of the organic layer. I will then take all
samples with a 7 cm diameter soil core to a depth of 5 cm. We chose
these particular dimensions (width x depth) for two reasons. For one, a
small diameter equals a small sample that reflects the clustered nature
of seed banks. A larger number of smaller samples is beneficial because
it increases the precision of seed density estimates compared to a small
number of larger samples [@bigwood1988a][@calster2008a][@stark2008]. It
is important to note that this relationship between sample size and
precision covaries with the species abundance in the soil [@mahé2020].
Further, a larger set of small samples may facilitate sampling a larger
percentage of the total area after accounting for a smaller variance of
the seed bank as you decrease plot size (*i.e.*, 1 m2) [@mickelson2003].
In terms soil diameter, there is no consensus on the best choice for the
size of diameter and it seems like obtaining a higher number of soil
samples is more appropriate than a larger soil diameter [@bigwood1988].
Second, seeds of *V. rossicum* tend to die off in depths deeper than 5
cm [probably because their smaller seeds lower change of seed longevity
in the soil - double-check] [@ditommaso2017a].

Previous studies suggest early season sampling is a good timing if one
wishes to assess a perennial seed bank as "some of the transient seeds
germinate in the autumn, some seeds die during the winter and seeds
undergo a cold period, sometimes required to break seed dormancy"
**(cite that Devlaeminck et al., 2004)**.

Since I will be collecting samples around [spring-summer?], I will then
seal composite samples in plastic bags and refrigerate them at 4°C for a
maximum of ten days prior to processing at the green house. Previous
studies have shown that cold-stratification (e.g., 18 weeks) improves
the emergence rate when the harvest date is in Fall rather than Summer
[@ditommaso2005a]. Note: some of the highest germination rates (30-50%)
among fresh seed collections were from samples collected in open
old-field habitats during the later Summer (August) [@ditommaso2005a].

After a five-day refrigeration period, I will air-dry the seed samples
in paper bags house in a dark environment and subject the samples to
several concentrating steps [@heerdt1996] by sieving them on a coarse
4‐mm sieve and removing mosses and plant material that could influence
seedling germination results. Then I will analyze the number of seed
germinants of *Vincetoxicum rossicum* using the seedling emergence
method. Here, emergence is defined as "corresponds to a presence of a
seedling at the soil surface"[@mahé2020], which implies that this method
reflects the species and individuals that are able to emerge in the
field [@espeland2010]. [add in another sentence about why we should look
at emerged seedlings and how that relates to invasion literature]. Also,
many plant species emerged in the first month using this method
[@espeland2010]. Altogether, this approach is suitable for answering my
research questions.

Here, I will fill 60 plastic germination trays with 1 cm of sterilized
sand and 2 cm of sterilized potting soil (Sun Gro Metro-Mix®). I will
then spread the field collected soil samples evenly over the
sand-potting soil mixture at 0.5 cm thickness to ensure complete
germination. I will then fill five additional trays with the
sand-potting soil mixture only and randomly dispersed them throughout
the greenhouse to serve as control trays to track any weed seeds or
potential contaminants **(cite?)**. Every five days, I will check trays
for new germinants of *Vincetoxicum rossicum*. Multiple seedlings
originating from a single seed (polyembryony) were treated as a single
seedling **(cite)**? Soil PH also has little effect on seedling
emergence [@magidow2013]. I will randomly reassign the location of each
tray once per week inside the greenhouse to reduce the effect of any
spatial variations in temperature and light intensity. "[plants were
subjected to a 14 hr/10 hr day/night light cycle and watered with an ebb
and flow‐system every 2 days]". I will monitor germination over a period
of five months. While previous buried seed bank studies on *Vincetoxicum
rossicum* suggest that two years is required to capture all potential
germinants [@ditommaso2017], I was primarily interested in the species
that germinated first and most abundantly as these have a competitive
advantage in establishment.

There are a number of limitations for seedling emergence methods
[@mahé2020]. After accounting for seed dormancy (using cold
stratification), the most important one is that germination conditions
cannot be appropriate to all species in the samples, and this affects
the detection of particular species. But, I have a target invasive
species so adjustments to temperature, sunlight, and moisture can be
modified to promote the growth of *V. rossicum* [@ditommaso2017a].

Some notes about growth chamber space:

-   Shin's experiment has 18.75 inch square pots (area: 116 $cm^{2}$) in
    the chamber.

-   The chamber holds 18 shelves and Shin has 18 pots in each shelf

-   So the total area of the chamber: 116 \* 18 \* 18 = 37584 $cm^{2}$

-   According to the SEM model, we need a sample size of 60 (where a
    unit of observation is a 1 $m^{2}$ plot for vegetative surveys). For
    seedling emergence, this means that we need 60 trays to represent
    the *V.rossicum* perennial seed banks of 60 plots. Add in an extra
    two trays to keep track of pathogens and unwanted weeds.

-   We need to see if there's enough space in the growth chamber to hold
    60 trays. If there's enough, we can look around to find suitable
    dimensions. If not, we have to revise the SEM model to accommodate
    the trade-off between sample size and logistics (amount of storage
    space).

-   So, we can divide the total area of the chamber by the number of
    shelves (according to Antonio). We get: 37584 $cm^{2}$ / 18 = 2088
    $cm^{2}$ , which is the total area of a single shelf.

-   Let's assume we can have four trays per shelf (total trays here:
    4\*18 = 72) to make the math a bit easier (and conservative). So we
    get: 2088 $cm^{2}$/4 = 522 $cm^{2}$, which is the total area for a
    single tray on a single shelf in the growth chamber.

-   If we assume we need trays with a height of 1 cm, then the volume of
    a single tray should be 9405 $cm^{2}$ \* 1 $cm^{2}$ = 522 $cm^{3}$.
    This is a very conservative estimate.

-   We're also assuming that we're collecting soil samples using a soil
    core of 7 cm (diameter) by 5 cm (depth). Let's approximate the shape
    of soil core to that of a cylinder. So the volume of each soil
    samples is then $\pi r^{2}h = \pi * (3.5cm)^2*5cm$ = 192.42
    $cm^{3}$.

-   The final calculation: the volume of a single tray divided by the
    volume of a a single soil sample = 522/192.42 = \~**2.7 samples**.

-   How many other ecologists collected soil samples per plot? Lots of
    variability here...

    -   [@eschtruth2011a]: Two soil samples per plot using a 20 cm
        diameter by 10 cm depth soil core in riparian ecosystems.

    -   [@doroski2020]: Five soil samples per plot (four outside; one at
        the plot center) using a 7 cm diameter by 7 cm depth soil core
        in small urban parks, large urban parks, and vacant lots.

    -   [@albrecht2011]: Two soil samples per plot using a 10 cm X 10 cm
        X 10 cm soil core in urban wastelands.

<!--# Should make a table of all the germinants with family, genus, species, life-form, native/alien status, invasive status, and number of seeds germinated [although, I am primarily interested in invasive plants though, but having a decent tracklist would help a bit here.] -->

<!--# “Shallow layering of soil samples has been shown to enhance overall germination rates (Kjellsson 1992) ” -->

<!--# “In trying to simulate nature in the laboratory, attention should be paid to the time when the seeds are dispersed. If seeds are dispersed in autumn, they need to be given cold stratification, whereas if they are dispersed in spring, they need to be given warm stratification treatments. What are cold and warm stratification treatments? This means that seeds are placed on a moist substrate at representative winter (cold stratification) or summer (warm stratification) temperatures” [@baskin1998] -->

<!--# “It is especially important that soil samples from habitats in the temperate zone be given cold stratification treatments, but it also is important that they receive simulated summer conditions. In a heated greenhouse, samples would receive simulated summer, but not winter temperature regimes” [@baskin1998]. -->

#### Seed rain index

A complete map of all exotic plant species within a \~70 m radius of
each plot [@ditommaso2018] was used to calculate a plot-level seed rain
index ($SR$):

$SR = \sum_{n=1}^{N}fecundity*e^{-b}{distance_{n}}$

where $SR$ is the seed rain index, $N$ is the total number of
individuals of a given exotic species within the 70 m radius,
$fecundity$ is the number of seeds produced per plant, $distance$ is the
distance in meters to each individual within 70 m ($n$), and $b$ is the
dispersal coefficient for the negative exponential seed dispersal curve
[@eschtruth2009; @eschtruth2011]. While the plot level seed rain index
was calculated to verify the results of the direct germination method
(see above), it is not as complete a measure of propagule pressure;
particularly when comparing sites with different dispersal vectors. The
seed rain model would predominately capture the wind dispersed fraction
of *V. rossicum* seeds [@ditommaso2018].

The number of seeds produced per plant ($fecundity$) per year was
determined from weighted mean values reported in the literature (i.e.,
130 number of seeds per stem per year; [@averill2011]). Variation in
plant size and environmental conditions can substantially alter the
number of seeds produced per individual **(cite, cite, cite)** and only
some of this variation is incorporated into the reported mean values.
However, these numbers are used only to establish a relative index of
propagule pressure. Dispersal coefficients ($b$) have not been
determined for these species. Therefore, we calculated values by
integrating across the dispersal kernel based on the assumption that 95%
of seeds would be dispersed within the maximum effective dispersal
distance reported in the literature for each species [@ditommaso2018].
Check [Wilson, 1993] to compare values against the dispersal
coefficient.

#### Distance to roads

It is common for invasion biologists to use "distance to roads" as a
surrogate for propagule pressure (different exotic species:
[@catford2011]; *Microstegium vimineum:* Warren et al, 2013; )

since close proximity to roads can increase the chance of invasion
vectors to disperse propagules into nearby habitats. Although, the
dispersal mechanism is unclear as human agents (*i.e.,* cars, bikes,
human foot traffic) may facilitate spread among roads.

### Biotic interactions

At each site, I measured three functional traits (according to
standardized protocols) for each species that were outside the plots.
For plant height, I chose 25 healthy individuals (i.e., low exposure to
pathogens or herbivory) for each species that had their foliage exposed
to full sunlight. For each individual, we measured the maximum height of
the foliage of the species (disregarding inflorescences)
[@perez-harguindeguy2016]. <!--# something about bent plants? -->. From
a subsample of the 25 healthy individuals for each species (n = 10), I
then took four healthy leaves (with attached twigs, if possible) from
plant parts most exposed to direct sunlight [@perez-harguindeguy2016].
For storage, I wrapped up the four leaves for each individual in moist
paper (with deionised water) and put them in sealed (and labelled)
plastic bags [@perez-harguindeguy2016]. For each bag, I breathed into
the bag before closing it to enhance CO2 concentration and air humidity,
and then I stored the bags in the dark [@perez-harguindeguy2016] in a
fridge (2-6 °C) for up to 24 hours. For measuring specific leaf area, I
took each leaf (after patting it dry) and placed it on a flatbed scanner
[instrument name] and measured leaf area using ImageJ **(cite)**.

Height is related to competitive vigor [@gaudet1988].

SLA is tightly correlated with photosynthetic capacity
[@ryser2000][@wright2004] [@shipley2006]

Stem diameter is related to competitive vigor [@sodhi2019]

Those three <!-- soft ?---> traits (to be measured) are RESPONSE traits
that reflect biotic and abiotic conditions --\> describe and predict
species responses to changes in these factors [@lavorel2002]. It seems
that response traits are thought to be more sensitive to intraspecific
trait variation rather than interspecific variation [@albert2011].

Some folks suggest you should rigorously sample functional traits at the
plot-scale for community assembly research questions rather than using
surrogates (proxies) from trait databases
[@cordlandwehr2013][@albert2011]. E.g., select individuals at random for
each plot: 3 reps for height. For the leaf trait measurements, three
leaves from three different individuals (total of nine leaves).
<!--check the 2016 field handbook though-->. We sampled all species at
the flowering stage to compare all species in the same phenological
stage as it is the standard procedure in trait databases.
<!-- should sample plots within a disturbance regime?, look up more papers on traits and disturbances -->

Papers to read:

-   [@perronne2017]

### Disturbance

Some relevant papers?

-   Across multiple species and habitats, disturbance events appear to
    benefit non-native (including invasive) species than native ones,
    especially in observational studies (but authors might have just
    picked sites where high disturbance levels had a strong effect on
    plant communities) [@jauni2015]. Although, there is no effect of
    disturbance on non-native plants for either urban sites or plant
    removals (e.g., mowing)... maybe disturbance doesn't play a strong
    role in promoting invasion under certain situations.

### Causal pathways

See below for a list of conceptual pathways describing the relationships
between invasibility, plant diversity, propagule pressure and
disturbance. Pathways are organized according to the expected pattern
created, the causal direction of the pathway, and a proposed mechanism.

-   Number of seed propagules --\> invasibility: a higher supply of
    plant propagule introductions (seed bank) increases the
    susceptibility of an ecosystem to plant invasion [@eschtruth2011;
    @houseman2014] via the propagule pressure hypothesis proposed by
    [@lonsdale1999a].

$ln(\frac{I_{e}}{1-I_{e}}) \sim \beta_{1}PP_{sb} + e_{1}$

$I_{e} \in R: 0 \le I_{e} \le 1$

$PP_{sb} \in R: 0 \le PP_{sb} \le \infty$

$e_{1} \sim N(0,1)$

-   Seed rain --\> invasibility: a higher supply of plant propagule
    introdeuctions (seed rain) increases the susceptibility of an
    ecosystem to plant invasion [@eschtruth2011; @houseman2014] via the
    propagule pressure hypothesis proposed by [@lonsdale1999a].

$ln(\frac{I_{e}}{1-I_{e}}) \sim \beta_{2}PP_{sr} + e_{2}$

$I_{e} \in R: 0 \le I_{e} \le 1$

$PP_{sb} \in R: 0 \le PP_{sb} \le 1$

$e_{2} \sim N(0,1)$

-   Seed rain --\> seed bank: Close proximity of invasive plant
    individuals to a focal point contributes a higher supply (size) of
    propagules to the seed bank [@eschtruth2011 @londe2017
    @marchante2010].

    $ln(PP_{sb}) \sim \beta_{3}PP_{sr} + e_{3}$

    $PP_{sb} \in R: 0 \le PP_{sb} \le +\infty$

    $PP_{sb} \in R: 0 \le PP_{sb} \le 1$

    $e_{3} \sim N(0,1)$

-   Mowing --\> light --\> invasibility: Increase in mowing frequency as
    a disturbance event, reducing resident species biomass, which then
    increase light availability for invasion via the fluctuating
    resource availability hypothesis [@averill2010 @davis20

-   Mowing --\> soil moisture --\> invasibility: Increase in mowing
    frequency as a disturbance event, reducing resident species biomass,
    which then increase soil moisture for invasion via the fluctuating
    resource availability hypothesis [@averill2010 @davis2000]
